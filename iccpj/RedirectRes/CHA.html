        <h2>Deadly heat waves fueled by climate change are threatening India’s development, study says</h2>
        <p>Heat waves have already critically impacted the country, leading to power outages, increased dust and air pollution, and accelerated glacial melt in the north of India, researchers from the University of Cambridge said in the study published in the journal PLOS Climate on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Since 1992, more than 24,000 people have died because of heat waves in India, the study said.</p>
        <p>And the impacts are expected to get worse as heat waves become more frequent, intense and lethal due to the climate crisis.</p>
        <p>“India is currently facing a collision of multiple cumulative climate hazards,” said the researchers.</p>
        <p>“Long-term projections indicate that Indian heat waves could cross the survivability limit for a healthy human resting in the shade by 2050.”</p>
        <p>The study shows that millions more people in India are vulnerable to climate change than first thought. More than 90% of the country could be severely impacted by heat waves, falling into an extreme heat “danger” zone, according to the heat index, the study found.</p>
        <p>The heat index is how hot it feels and considers both air temperature and humidity to assess the heat’s impact on the population.</p>
        <p>Last year, India experienced a searing heat wave, during which parts of the country reached more than 49°C (120°F).</p>
        <p>In 2022, India experienced its hottest April in 122 years and its hottest March on record, the study said. And it experienced extreme weather on 242 out of 273 days between January and October 2022.</p>
